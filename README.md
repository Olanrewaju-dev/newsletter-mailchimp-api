# Hey There :blush: !
Thank you for your interest in my web app. This is a Nodejs ES6 newsletter app with MailChimp API.


I hope to open source it later so anyone can fork it, modify it and use it however you like if you are trying to build a newsletter sign up page.
Note, you'll need to sign up to MailChimp API to generate API key and other credentials.


## Features
   - Subscribes new member to a designated list within a MailChimp account.
   - Check if a member already exist.
   - Update an existing member's credentials besides email.

## Features you can add
   - Doesn't delete a user from the designated list.
